                        “I highly recommend the recruitment services of Steve Hutton, Employment Leaders. I've continued to use Steve's services at 3 different companies in different segments of healthcare. He and his group have done an excellent job of finding the right combination of skills, behaviors and cultural fit in each of the assignments I've given him. While most have been in sales, he has also filled many operational and general management roles as well. Steve takes the time to understand the company, its competitive advantage, the fit required and then he finds high performing candidates that 9 out of 10 times is potentially great hire. 

                        He does an excellent job of preparing and closing the candidates so we have had a high success rate at bringing his candidates on.  He also stays in touch with his placements to make sure they are successful in their new roles and communicates as necessary when there are problems.  I thoroughly enjoy working with Steve as he has done a great job for my different organizations.”

                        First I want to make an assurance to you that I am do not make it a custom of endorsing service providers to our company. I, in the preponderant of instances, regard relations of this kind as strictly business and quid pro quo. Steve on the other hand is regarded as a true member of our team and has vitally contributed to the progress that our company has made over this past year.

                        I would judge the competency of a recruiter by the following criteria:

                        Access to the important key contributors in our field.
                        The scope of their or her sphere of influence and their ability to quickly contact appropriate candidates.
                        Understanding of the field and knowledge of the critical influences and success factors of the positions that are being recruited.
                        Follow through and ability to close a deal.

                        Steve is outstanding at each of these components of search. I have been amazed at how efficiently he has been able to turn around assignments that he has been given. I am equally amazed by the fact that speed does not compromise the quality of the candidates that he has presented. Moreover Steve has not hesitated in helping us in areas that would not result in his earning a fee. He has demonstrated a team spirit and real interest in adding value to his client.

                        In the years that I have been involved in recruiting and in my dealings with search professionals I have rarely been associated with such professionalism and competency.

                        Steve:

                        With the brand new year, I wanted to take time to say thanks so much for all your help during my first few months at U.T. In my career in the industry, I have had the occasion to work with numerous recruiters. I must say that my experience with you as been unique. Your ability to find candidates who fit the challenging profile which we established has been impressive. You didn't just settle with one or two candidates - you consistently managed to find more. You were open to honest feedback when I crossed some off the list, and you went back to the well for even more. You provided assistance in scheduling interviews and maintained flexibility to reschedule throughout challenging travel plans. Most importantly, your candor and professionalism has been thoroughly appreciated.

                        I look forward to working with you more in the future.

                        Thanks again for all your assistance.

                        I had an exceptional experience working with Steve Hutton at Employment Leaders. He is, without a doubt, the most knowledgeable recruiter I have had the pleasure of collaborating with. Steve reached out to me at the perfect moment and introduced me to the best opportunity in my career. His in-depth understanding of the company was impressive, and I recently discovered that he had successfully recruited several other sales professionals who are also a part of my team. Steve is an invaluable resource, and his expertise in the field is unmatched. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking a top-tier recruiter.
